# synich's blog

A pure static personal website, with some long articles(rumination) and a tiddlywiki like piece collection support search.content explain

* index.html/style.css: obviously
* rumi: my long time think of some topic
* tm.html: a tittlememo collect my sparse time think, maybe some time it will be rumi

all the html is generated by my another repo: `essay`
